## LIMITATION

> [!WARNING]
> for kinds with more than 8000 schema fields, the program goes very slow down; i experienced with a 'Pod' with about 8000+ fields.
> the bubbletea' viewport is not optimized for this case. should implement one for lazy loading of rendering content.

## Roadmap

- this is a dashboard only for read operations, NO writes
